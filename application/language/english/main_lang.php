            <p>My name is Tanya Prykhodko – Ukrainian photographer, based in Dubai, UAE. I explore multiple styles of photography, with a central focus on portraits, beauty and fashion shooting. With a special interest towards weddings, documentary photography and many other forms to capture each moment.</p>
            <p>I’ve always been creative since childhood, and the aspiration to express this quickly grew towards pursuing multiple creative fields such as modelling, styling and a make-up. At 14 I begun to take a part in professional competitions and shootings, working next to skilled photographers, directors, actors and musicians, who helped me discover the art of photography. The desire to explore, to capture and to inspire follows me everywhere I go. I concentrate on improving myself during my journey and enjoy sharing brand new shades of beauty with the world of photography.</p>
            <p>People say that I capture the natural emotions and beauty with each shot, I strongly believe in showing everyone a world through my eyes. Each shoot is displays a unique mood to the moment and it’s exceptional story. I think these words describe works, are more so my character and my life style.</p>
            <p>Besides photography, I professionally practice horse riding, crave spontaneous traveling, and am addicted to both fashion and cars. Favourite quote, Words of genius Steve Jobs: «The ones, who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do» has become my life’s credo.</p>
            <p>I’ll do my best to find the approach to all my clients and consider any wishes during working process. A compromise is possible in almost all the situations, including your budget and desired locations.</p>
            <p>Be sure that you’ll  get professional high quality photos, which you would love to share! Together we will bring all your ideas to life, going by European experience in Arabic world.</p>
